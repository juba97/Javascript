// 1) What will be the result for these expressions?

5 > 4
"apple" > "pineapple"
"2" > "12"
undefined == null
undefined === null
null == "\n0\n"
null === +"\n0\n"

//The answer is:
5 > 4 → true
"apple" > "pineapple" → false
"2" > "12" → true
undefined == null → true
undefined === null → false
null == "\n0\n" → false
null === +"\n0\n" → false

/*
    Some of the reasons:


        Obviously, true.
        Dictionary comparison, hence false. "a" is smaller than "p".
        Again, dictionary comparison, first char "2" is greater than the first char "1".
        Values null and undefined equal each other only.
        Strict equality is strict. Different types from both sides lead to false.
        Similar to (4), null only equals undefined.
        Strict equality of different types.
